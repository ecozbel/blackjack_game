# BlackJack Game

By: Ceyhun, Aliya and Lien 


Rules:

-Player plays against the dealer
-Player is given 2 cards initially, they can “hit” to ask for more cards or “stand” 
-While “hitting” if player passes 21, they lose
-When player “stands”, the dealer plays
-Dealer draws a new card until they reach at least 16, and stops drawing if they have a hand 
between 17 and 21 (dealer always plays with the same logic in BlackJack)
-Once dealer is done, player’s hand is compared to the dealer’s, whoever is closer to 21 wins
-The K, Q and J are worth 10,  value of the Ace can be 1 or 11
-If you get a 21 (For example Ace + J), it’s BlackJack!
